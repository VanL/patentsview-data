# Patentsview data
Updates and fixes to patentsview data (http://www.patentsview.org).

From the Patentsview site:
*The PatentsView database is sourced from USPTO-provided text and XML data on published patent applications (2001-most recent update) and granted patents (1976-most recent update). The current PatentsView database MySQL dump is available for download, upon request. The patent applications database, which contains all granted and non-granted applications, is also available upon request. After March, 2016, the applications database will not contain the same inventor IDs as the PatentsView database. Only inventors on granted applications can be matched between the PatentsView and applications databases via a granted application ID.*
